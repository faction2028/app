### About Faction 2028

Faction 2028 challenges players to govern, strategize, and contribute in response to a signal from beyond Earth. Using real-world data, dynamic NFTs (dNFTs), and programmable faction logic, players coordinate to prepare for what comes next.

It is the first full application built on TAP (The Atom Project), an execution environment with a sandboxed AVM (Atomicals Virtual Machine) that anchors gameplay to the Atomicals Protocol. All actions in the system are verified locally and transparently. Nothing runs unless it passes through logic that can be proven and trusted.

Faction 2028 begins as a game. It evolves into a decentralized protocol shaped by the people who participate.
